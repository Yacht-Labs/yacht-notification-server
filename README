To run the docker postgres container:
`docker run --name yacht-notification-server -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=user -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -d postgres`

To create the first database in the server open a terminal and enter:
`docker exec -it yacht-notification-server psql -U user`

Now execute the following code:
`CREATE DATABASE yacht_db;`
You can confirm that the database was created by entering `\l`
Exit the terminal with `quit()`

To set up the database, run `npm run db-generate`
followed by
`npm run db-migrate`

If you have to run any migrations in the future, just run `npm run db-migrate NAME_OF_YOUR_MIGRATION`

To initialize the token database, run `npm run db-init`

You should now have token data in your db

To view the database data within your web browser(Prisma Studio), run `npm run db-view`
