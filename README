To create the first database in the server open a terminal and enter:
`docker exec -it yacht-notification-server psql -U user`

Now execute the following code:
`CREATE DATABASE yacht_db;`
You can confirm that the database was created by entering `\l`
Exit the terminal with `quit()`

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/yacht_db?schema=public"
EULER_GRAPH_ENDPOINT =
  "https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/euler-xyz/euler-mainnet";
```

To generate the tables, enter `npx prisma migrate dev`
